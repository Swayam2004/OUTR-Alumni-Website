🎓 Alumni Association is not just any alumni platform—it’s the Tony Stark of networking! 🦸‍♂️ Powered by ⚛️ React.js, enhanced with 🌈 Tailwind CSS, and turbocharged by JavaScript, this site is hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring it runs as smoothly as your cleanest commit (the one with no bugs). 🐛

🔍 With advanced filters by year, batch, and department, plus a search bar quicker than Stack Overflow, finding your fellow alumni is effortless. Alumni can create profiles, browse job opportunities 💼, and stay up-to-date with events. With its mobile-first design 📱, it looks sleek whether you're on a laptop, phone, or smart device.

🔐 Secure authentication? Already in place—because we take your data more seriously than Thanos takes his Infinity Stones. 💎

Our greatest challenges? Getting the filters to work faster than your last optimization attempt and keeping the UI as clean as a freshly initialized repo. Thanks to Tailwind's utility-first approach, our code is sharp and stylish! 🛠️

🚀 What’s next? We’re working on event RSVPs and reminders, so you’ll never miss out on alumni reunions and key events, even if your calendar management skills aren’t your strong suit. 🗓️
